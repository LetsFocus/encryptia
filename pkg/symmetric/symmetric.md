# Symmetric Encryption:

## What is Symmetric Encryption:
- Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. 
- It is one of the most widely used encryption techniques due to its simplicity and efficiency. 
- The main concept is that both the sender and the receiver must possess the same secret key, which is kept private and never shared publicly.

## Types of Symmetric Encryption's:

1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   Usage: Very High
   Details: AES is the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm. It's the standard for encrypting data in various applications, including SSL/TLS, file encryption, and VPNs. It is recommended for nearly all new encryption implementations.

2. ChaCha20
   Usage: High
   Details: ChaCha20 is increasingly popular, especially in scenarios where performance is critical, such as on mobile devices. It's used in modern protocols like TLS as an alternative to AES, particularly in environments where AES hardware acceleration is not available.

3.  Blowfish
    Usage: Moderate
    Details: Blowfish is still in use, particularly in older systems and certain software applications. However, due to its 64-bit block size, it is not recommended for new implementations, and users are encouraged to transition to AES or other modern algorithms.

4. Twofish
   Usage: Moderate to Low
   Details: Twofish, while secure, is less commonly used compared to AES. It remains a good alternative in scenarios where AES is not suitable, but it has not seen widespread adoption.
